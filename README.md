# CNNs projects
My own implementations of various Convolutional Neural Networks projects inspired by various online courses.
* [CNN binary classifier](https://github.com/vgkortsas/CNNs_TensorFlow/tree/master/CNN_binary_classifier): Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect from their picture whether a person is happy or not.
     * [Jupyter Notebook (TensorFloe 1.14)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/vgkortsas/CNNs_projects/blob/master/CNN_binary_classifier/CNN_binary_classifier.ipynb)
* [Residual Neural Network](https://github.com/vgkortsas/CNNs_TensorFlow/tree/master/Residual_Neural_Network): Implement and train a state-of-the-art Residual Neural Network (ResNet) for image classification.

## Requirements
A full list of the requirements is given for each project separately. The deep learning library used in all projects is TensorFlow 1.x.
