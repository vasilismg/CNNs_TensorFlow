# CNNs using TensorFlow


The following projects are based on the programming assignments of deeplearning.ai, course Convolutional Neural Networks. They were implemented in Keras and I reimplemented them using TensorFlow.

* [Project 1](https://github.com/vasilismg/CNNs_TensorFlow/tree/master/Detect_happiness): Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect from their picture whether a person is happy or not.

* [Project 2](https://github.com/vasilismg/CNNs_TensorFlow/tree/master/Residual_Neural_Network): Implement and train a state-of-the-art Residual Neural Network (ResNet) for image classification.
