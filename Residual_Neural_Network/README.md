# Residual Neural Network

[Residual Neural Network](https://github.com/vgkortsas/CNNs_projects/blob/master/Residual_Neural_Network/Residual_Network.ipynb): Implement and train a state-of-the-art Residual Neural Network (ResNet) for image classification.

This project is based on the corresponding programming assignment of deeplearning.ai, course Convolutional Neural Networks. It was implemented in Keras and I reimplemented it using TensorFlow 1.14.

## Requirements
A full list of the requirements is given [here](https://github.com/vgkortsas/CNNs_projects/blob/master/Residual_Neural_Network/requirements.txt). The Python and deep learning library versions are:
- Python 3.5.5
- TensorFlow 1.14.0
