# CNN binary classifier


[CNN binary classifier](https://github.com/vgkortsas/CNNs_projects/blob/master/CNN_binary_classifier/CNN_binary_classifier.ipynb): Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect from their picture whether a person is happy or not.

This project is based on the corresponding programming assignment of deeplearning.ai, course Convolutional Neural Networks. It was implemented in Keras and I reimplemented it using TensorFlow 1.14.

## Requirements
A full list of the requirements is given [here](https://github.com/vgkortsas/CNNs_projects/blob/master/CNN_binary_classifier/requirements.txt). The Python and deep learning library versions are:
- Python 3.5.5
- TensorFlow 1.14.0
